# myownnumpy

Numpy is a great project! love it to the core. This mere human trying to see if it can implement it from scratch. 

I will focus on 2D arrays primarily. 

TODO:

 * [ ]  Basic functionalities like add, sub, multiply, matrix multiplication
 * [ ]  If possible, broadcasting
 * [ ]  SIMD
